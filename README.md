Code for "Monitoring ICU Mortality Risk with A Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network".

This is a project to reproduce the authors' claims in the paper mentioned above. We will be implementing techniques such as Latent Semantic Analysis, 
Self-attention, Long Short Term Memory, bi-LSTM, Average pooling, SAPS-II as mentioned in the paper.
